 ## Image label generation
After capturing thousands of images of the past 20 years it can be difficult to track down or retieve the ones you want.  There is commercial software available, such as Eagle, for annotations an labels.  However you would still have to review the images and design a tagging or labeling nomenclature stategy.

This example project captures 3 different approaches.
1. Python Scripting  
2. Hugging Face supplied models to label the image activity 
3. Vector Database & Index methods to capture activity (precursor for RAG)

## 1. Image label generation

There is commercial software available, such as Eagle, for annotations an labels.  However you would still have to review the images and design a tagging or labeling nomenclature stategy.

This example project captures 3 different approaches.
1. Hugging Face trained models(Blip-2) to label the activity in the image, known as caption.
2. Python Scripting - loop folders and directories to build inventory of file details including captions
	'''img_capture_folder.py''' 
3. Vector Database & Index methods to capture activity (precursor for RAG)

## 2. Summarizing Private Data
Created a Chatbot as a Python Flask app that can examine your private data and summarize the information.
