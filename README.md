## 1. Image label generation
After capturing thousands of images of the past 20 years it can be difficult to track down or retieve the ones you want.

2. Hugging Face supplied models to label the image activity 
3. Vector Database & Index methods to capture activity (precursor for RAG)

## 2. Summarizing Private Data
